## 2026-04-04: Clear `seen` in structural subCheckNF recursive calls

**Agent:** ochre-20260404-224040

**Decision:** Changed subCheckNF's lam-lam and app-app structural cases to
use empty `seen` `[]` instead of propagating the outer seen set.

**Why:** The outer `seen` set contains equi-recursive assumptions like
(σ, mu ann body) with VCompat callbacks in adequacy_gen tied to the original
value `v`. When the proof needs to recurse into structural sub-components
(e.g., f1→f2 in app-app), the callback would need VCompat for the
*sub-component* (fV), not the original v. This mismatch was the fundamental
blocker for proving app-app structural congruence in adequacy_gen.

By clearing seen in structural recursive calls, the callback becomes vacuous
(empty seen = no callback), enabling the proof.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Strengthen the seen callback to `∀ v, VCompat n v p.1 → VCompat n v p.2`
   (too strong — fails for from_type_sub_gen)
2. Prove `subCheckNF with seen → subCheckNF with []` (wrong direction — more
   seen pairs make subCheckNF succeed more, not less)
3. Keep the definition and accept the app-app case can't be proved (unacceptable
   — app-app is a core case)

**Validation:** All tests pass including the north star (appendVec). The
structural recursive calls don't benefit from equi-recursive assumptions
anyway — they compare structural sub-parts (domains, bodies, function/arg
components), not the mu types that the seen set tracks.

**Impact:** Enables the app-app structural congruence proof in adequacy_gen
(all 4 VCompat sub-cases). Also prepares the lam-lam case for future work.
Fuel_mono proof required minor update (changing `seen` to `[]` in `show`
clauses).
