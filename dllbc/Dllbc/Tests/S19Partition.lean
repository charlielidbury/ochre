# §19 test suite — partition (model + imperative), built on the M18 stack

This milestone assembles the crystallized architecture into its first real
algorithm: an in-place Lomuto partition through a mutable borrow, whose declared
backward spec is the pure `partitionL` model, checked by conversion per path.

It opens with the smallest complete instance of the architecture — a `swapS`
caller that recovers the precise `swapL i j s` (M17) and certifies its count with
`count_swapL'` (M18) — and gates the imperative body on a machine probe: splitting
the driver on a STUCK Bool spine (`leb x pivot`, x symbolic), which the current
substitution-based ⇜ cannot do without generalizing the spine first.
