# DLLBC Concrete Machine (§2)

The runtime interpreter for the doc's §2: the two runtime arrows

  * `readR : Term → M Val`   — the doc's ⇒ (consume-read / move), and
  * `writeR : Term → Val → M Unit` — the doc's ⇐ (destructive fill),

plus the two **reorganizations** the arrows fire *lazily* (doc §2's standing
convention — the environment is only rewritten when a rule's premise demands
it):

  * `endMut ℓ`  — End-Mut: plug a borrow's current payload back where its loan
    marker sits, and kill the borrow to ⊥.
  * `drop v`    — §2.3's total procedure: end the displaced value's ownership
    nodes innermost-first, then discard the remainder.

Both reorganizations reduce to two Ω-primitives — `killBorrowInΩ` and
`sendPayloadToLoan` — which is why "the borrow machinery has no rules of its
own beyond bookkeeping" (§2.5).

Totality: no `partial`. Value-tree traversals are structural (mutual with a
list helper). The reorganize-then-retry loops (`readR` on a loan chain,
`drop` ending several nodes) take an explicit fuel `Nat`, so the whole machine
is kernel-transparent for the later proof phase. Later milestones add
`readC`/`writeC` (⇝/⇜) with parallel signatures.

    internal reborrow suspension travelling with it; only markers in owned
    position must be ended (End-Mut) before the value can be moved or matched.

/-! ## The two Ω-primitives

    Everything the borrow machinery does is one of these two, aimed at Ω's
    own bookkeeping (§2.5: "no rules of its own beyond bookkeeping"). Each
    errors distinctively when its target end is not an entry of Ω — the
    stuckness that rejects the self-reborrow (§2.5). -/

/-- Find the `borrowM ℓ p` node in Ω, set it to ⊥, and return its payload `p`.
    Errors if no such borrow is an entry (its other end may be in flight). -/
def killBorrowInΩ (ℓ : Nat) : M Val := do
  let ω ← getEnv
  match ω.findSome? (fun kv => findBorrowPayload ℓ kv.2) with
  | none =>
    throwErr s!"end: borrow of ℓ{ℓ} is not an entry of Ω (its other end is in flight — cannot end)"
  | some p => do
    setEnv (ω.map (fun kv => (kv.1, replaceBorrowWithBot ℓ kv.2)))
    pure p

/-- Find the `loanM ℓ` marker in Ω and replace it with payload `p` (send the
    borrowed value home). Errors if no such loan marker is an entry. -/
def sendPayloadToLoan (ℓ : Nat) (p : Val) : M Unit := do
  let ω ← getEnv
  if ω.any (fun kv => containsLoan ℓ kv.2) then
    setEnv (ω.map (fun kv => (kv.1, replaceLoanMarker ℓ p kv.2)))
  else
    throwErr s!"end: loan ℓ{ℓ} is not an entry of Ω (cannot plug payload back)"

/-- **End-Mut** (§2.2): take the borrow's current payload, plug it back where
    the loan marker sits, and kill the borrow to ⊥. Both ends must be entries
    of Ω (they are, whenever a ⇒-read forces this on a slot holding a loan). -/
def endMut (ℓ : Nat) : M Unit := do
  let p ← killBorrowInΩ ℓ
  sendPayloadToLoan ℓ p

/-- **Drop** (§2.3): the total procedure that vacates a displaced value. End
    its ownership nodes innermost-first — a `loanM ℓ` in the value kills its
    borrow in Ω and the payload returns into the value (re-scanned); a
    `borrowM ℓ p` in the value sends `p` home to its loan in Ω and the node
    becomes ⊥ — then discard the (now ownership-free) remainder.

    Each end requires the complementary end to be an entry of Ω, else the
    program is rejected (§2.5). Fuel bounds the reorganize-then-retry loop
    (the number of ownership nodes is finite). -/

      drop fuel (replaceLoanMarker ℓ p v)

      match findBorrowPayload ℓ v with

        drop fuel (replaceBorrowWithBot ℓ v)

/-! ## Places and their positions

    A place is a variable under zero or more `*` peels (`x`, `*x`, `**x`, …) —
    the only shapes ⇐ and `&mut` are *defined* on (doc §1.1). A `Pos` records
    the root variable and the peel count; navigation descends through borrow
    payloads. `&mut`, the ⇒-take of `*p`, and ⇐-fill all share this. -/

/-- A resolved place: a root variable and a number of `*` peels. -/
structure Pos where
  root : Var
  derefs : Nat
deriving Repr

/-- Resolve a place term to a `Pos`. Errors on any non-place shape, which is
    exactly how ⇐/`&mut` reject writes/borrows of arbitrary expressions. -/

  | .deref t => do let p ← placeToPos t; pure ⟨p.root, p.derefs + 1⟩
  | _ => throwErr "place: target is not a place (must be a variable under * peels)"

/-- Peel `n` borrow layers off `v`, returning the value at that depth. -/

  | _ + 1, .ctor n _ => throwErr s!"*: cannot peel constructor '{n}' (not a borrow)"

/-- Read the value at a resolved position (peeks; no side effect). -/
def getAtPos (pos : Pos) : M Val := do

/-- **⇐ (write)** — the fill-only write arrow, defined only on places. Its
    premise is a vacant (⊥) target; when the target is live a **drop** is
    forced first (§2.3), vacating it, then the value drops in. We vacate the
    slot *before* dropping so drop's Ω-scans never see a stale copy of the
    displaced value. -/
def writeR (fuel : Nat) (place : Term) (newval : Val) : M Unit := do
  let pos ← placeToPos place
  let old ← getAtPos pos

/-! ## Match branch selection (§3)

    These set up Ω for a branch and return the body term to evaluate; they do
    not call `readR`, so they stay outside the read recursion. `readR`'s match
    case reorganizes the scrutinee, then calls one of these, then reads the
    returned body. -/

  | _, _, _ => throwErr "match: constructor arity mismatch (borrow mode)"

/-- **Owned mode** (§3.1): ⇒-consume the scrutinee (slot → ⊥), select the
    branch by head constructor, move the fields into fresh binders, and return
    the branch body. -/

    bindFields br.binders fields

/-- **Borrow mode** (§3.3): the binders become reborrows of the fields. Mint a
    fresh loan ℓᵢ per field, park a `loanM ℓᵢ` in the parent's payload (which
    suspends the parent — no rule reads through a loan), bind each binder to
    `borrowM ℓᵢ fieldᵢ`, and return the branch body. -/

/-! ## ⇒ (read): the move arrow

    `readR` evaluates a term to a value with move semantics. Fuel decreases on
    every recursive call (including the End-Mut retry and the constructor-args
    loop), so the machine is total; the list helper `readArgs` keeps the
    constructor case structural. -/
